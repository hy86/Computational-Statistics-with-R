Computational Statistics with R: Predictive Model for 8th Grade Students’ Science IRT Score

This repositoty contains code and report researching on 8th grade students' science IRT score on family, community, school, and individual variables. This is a group work with Boyi Xue and Luyang Guo.

we use “The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) dataset in our research.

We first use stepwise model selection methods to find a best model with statistical significance. In part two, we use lasso regression, ridge regression and random forest methods and compare their cross-validated performance on mean squared prediction error. By doing so, we get the best prediction model with family, community, school, and individual variables with expected lowest error rate to predict upcoming students’ science score performance.
